; Database access information in Coral 2.0.0 should be unified
; (that is, same "type", "username", "password" and "host" for all modules)

; Each module has an "enabled" and an "installed" flag:
;;
; "Installed": Tells Coral whether or not the module has run its installer
;              before (this means that it has a database, configuration file and
;              whatever else the module may need to run)
; "Enabled":   Tells Coral whether or not the module is on/off
;
; The difference is that installed modules are upgraded (keeping their db etc.
; up to date) so they can be re-enabled. Non-installed modules do not have data
; that needs to be kept updated. Enabled simply flags modules for use in menus,
; interaction between modules etc.
