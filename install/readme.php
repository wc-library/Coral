/**
 * Installers have a single function (although this is not a rule) and its name
 * is register_{filename-without-extension}_requirement
 *
 * They return an associative array with at least the following elements:
 *  - uid					-> String: Unique identifier for this installer.
 *  - translatable_title	-> String: Title (that supports translation) that
 *  							users will understand.
 *  - installer				-> Function: Will be passed $shared_module_info
 *  							parameter and a well formed return variable is
 *  							expected (see below).
 *
 * In addition, optional elements include:
 *  - required					-> Bool: Whether or not the installer must run
 *  								for the installation to complete.
 *  - dependencies_array		-> Array (String): Uids of installers that must
 *  								run before this installer can run.
 *  - hide_from_completion_list	-> Bool: Whether or not the list of completed
 *  								installers should include this title (the
 *  								list is for the end user).
 *  - post_installation			-> Bool: Whether or not this installer should
 *  								only be run after installation is complete
 *  								(to do cleanup, for example). Useful to set
 *  								within a module installer to ensure that
 *  								anything that should be cleaned up is done
 *  								(e.g. config files are not writable).
 *  - shared_info				-> Assoc Array: Information to provide on the
 *  								$shared_module_info variable that will be
 *  								accessible to other installers before this
 *  								installer runs (such as request for a
 *  								database or a config file).
